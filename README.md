# README

The DAFT FM artist partner program is how we help artists thrive, by providing resources & services for:

- [Earn](#earn)
- [Grow](#grow)
- [Learn](#education)
- Tools

> There is no cost to any of these services. They are all pro-bono.


## Earn

We help you grow your audience by promoting _your work_ to _our audience_ on various channels like our website, YouTube, email list, like:

- [Reposting your shorts from other platforms](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qR5tQj3t420)
- [Posting your original tracks to rack up more views](https://youtu.be/9W765xvPSwg)

Once we have your permission to post your content on our channels, we will add your videos (music, content, etc.) to our YouTube channel and optimize them with SEO to reach both our current and future subscribers on YouTube and search engines.

You'll leverage our following + additional organic visitors and even share in any ad revenue generated from our videos, automatically with [YouTube's Creator Music Program](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12823912?hl=en&ref_topic=12755369&sjid=1076782615138773579-NC).

> TLDR/Summary:
>
> Creator Music is a YouTube program currently available to US YouTube Partner Program creators
> It allows content creators to use music while sharing revenue with rights holders
> There are two types of usage:
>
> Restricted usage: Limited to 30 seconds of music in videos 3+ minutes long
> Unrestricted usage: Allows use of any length of music in any video length
>
> Videos using revenue-sharing tracks will be monetized even if the creator doesn't turn monetization on
> Rights holders can track revenue-sharing videos through Studio Content Manager using a special icon
