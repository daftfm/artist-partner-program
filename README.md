## Growth

### Content Syndication/Promotion
We help you grow your audience by promoting _your work_ to _our audience_ on various channels like our website, youtube, email list, etc.

Once we have your permission to post your content on our channels we will add your videos (music, content, etc.) to our YouTube channel, and SEO optimize them to get your content in front of our subscribers - both current and future - from youtube and search engines.

> An additional `88,279` views from search engines by optimizing SEO:

In the video descriptions we will always include links to your website, your socials properties, etc. to make sure our subs can get to your brand. 

We will create pages for you on our [website](https://daft.fm/artists/daft-punk/), where we can include (embed) these videos, create sections in our online [community](https://github.com/orgs/daftfm/discussions), [Instagram #songoftheday feautres](https://www.instagram.com/dvnschmchr/reel/Cs64bz-r0iS/), and others - help you maximize your reach across the internet.


### Unique Content Creation
We can repost your popular videos, or even create original content specific to your music, like:

### Analytics & Tracking
We use a proprietary link shortener with built-in analytics & tracking so that can see data on how many clicks you're getting, where the people are coming from, etc.

> There is no cost to this. It's free.
