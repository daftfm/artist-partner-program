## Growth
We help you grow your audience by promoting _your work_ to _our audience_ on various channels like our website, youtube, email list, etc.

Once we have your permission to post your content on our channels we will add your videos (music, content, etc.) to our YouTube channel, and SEO optimize them to get your content in front of our subscribers - both current and future.

We repost your popular videos, and even create new content for you like lyric music videos [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDghI-UHCGM), [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FMdnelUHJM), etc.

In the video descriptions we will always include links to your website, your socials properties, etc. to make sure our subs can get to your brand. 

We also use a proprietary link shortener with built-in analytics & tracking so that can see data on how many clicks you're getting, where the people are coming from, etc.

These videos will also be embeded (added) to our website, and other relevant properties, to maximize your reach across the internet.

> There is no cost to this. It's free.


## Education
We help you with the *internet business* side of things with courses, coaching & mentorship for various growth hacks, online optimizations, etc. to help you succeed, like:

- How to make more money from your music by optimizing the release channels
