- [Education](#education)

## Growth
We help you grow your audience by promoting _your work_ to _our audience_ on various channels like our website, youtube, email list, etc.

Once we have your permission to post your content on our channels we will add your videos (music, content, etc.) to our YouTube channel, and SEO optimize them to get your content in front of our subscribers - both current and future.

We repost your popular videos, and even create new content for you like lyric music videos [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDghI-UHCGM), [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FMdnelUHJM), etc.

In the video descriptions we will always include links to your website, your socials properties, etc. to make sure our subs can get to your brand. We use a a proprietary link shortener and tracking system so that you will also have access to see data on how much clicks we are sending you, where the people are coming from, etc.

These videos will also be embeded (added) to our website, and other relevant properties, to maximize your reach across the internet.

> There is no cost to this. It's free.


## Education
We help you with the *internet business* side of things with courses, coaching & mentorship for various things that will help you succeed, like claiming your verified youtube artist topic channel and leveraging that to help you build out a more legitimate online presence, get your music in front of more people, etc.
