## Growth
We help you grow your audience by promoting your work to our audience through various channels, like:

- Website
- YouTube
- Email


## How it works

Once we have your permission to post your content on our channels we will add your videos (music, content, etc.) to our YouTube channel, and SEO optimize them to get your content in front of our subscribers - both current and future.

In the video description we will include links to your website, your socials properties, etc. to make sure our subs can get to your brand. We use a a proprietary link shortener and tracking system so that you will also have access to see data on how much clicks we are sending you, where the people are coming from, etc.

These videos wiill also be embeded (added) to our website, and other relevant properties, to maximize your reach across the internet.
