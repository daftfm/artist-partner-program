## Growth

### Content Syndication/Promotion
We help you grow your audience by promoting _your work_ to _our audience_ on various channels like our website, YouTube, email list, etc.

Once we have your permission to post your content on our channels, we will add your videos (music, content, etc.) to our YouTube channel and optimize them with SEO to reach both our current and future subscribers on YouTube and search engines.
